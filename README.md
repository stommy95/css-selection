# CSS Selection Homework

After you read James' CSS Selection, do the following:

1. If necessary, review this [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) about how to
  1. **Fork** this repository,
  2. **Clone** the Forked repo,
  3. After making changes to the code, **pushing** those changes to your Cloned code, and
  4. Submit this Clone as a **Pull Request** to the course organization's original repo.
2. During step 1.3, create a __**__new folder__**__ and name it, "<code>selection-lastname</code>", where "lastname" is your last name.
3. In this new folder, follow James' "SETUP" instructions and create a <code>selectors.html</code> file and a <code>style.css</code> file.
4. Follow his lead as he goes through CSS selection fundamentals. However, I would like you to put each section from the chapter inside its own &lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt; block element.
5. Label each section with James' provided subheading and mark it up with a level 2 heading block element: &lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;.
6. When you're done, push your code and submit a pull request to the [ENGL-4814 org's repo](https://github.com/engl-4814/css-selection).
